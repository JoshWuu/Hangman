# Project 1

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, students will be able to do all the following in Python:

* Name and create variables using Python conventions
* Use variables to store values
* Create strings with special characters
* Use string operators and methods to manipulate strings
* Print text to the console
* Create user prompts and take user input
* Create and use floats and ints
* Cast string, int, and float values
* Use numeric operators to manipulate ints and floats
* Create Boolean expressions
* Create conditional structures
* Create custom functions
* Create loop structures
* Use line comments to annotate code
* Use the Internet (including the Python Reference site) to find helpful information


## Overview

Students will be self-directing their learning. Your role is to faciliate their learning by circulating the classroom and regualarly checking in on them. Focus your efforts on helping students who are struggling the most.

When students have finished their first iteration, assign them into groups of 2 or 3 for them to test each others programs.

## Specific Expecations

A1.1 Use constants and **variables**, including integers, floating points, **strings**, and **Boolean values**, correctly in computer programs.

A1.3 Use **assignment statements** correctly with both arithmetic and string expressions in computer programs.

A1.4 Demonstrate the ability to use **Boolean operators** (e.g., AND, OR, NOT), **comparison operators** (i.e., equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to), **arithmetic operators** (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, parentheses), and order of operations correctly in computer programs.

A2.1 Write programs that incorporate **user input**, **processing**, and **screen output**.

A2.2 Use **sequence**, **selection**, and **repetition control** structures to create programming solutions.

A3.2 Write subprograms (e.g., **functions**, **procedures**) that use parameter passing and appropriate **variable scope** (e.g., local, global), to perform tasks within programs.

A4.1 Demonstrate the ability to identify and correct **syntax**, **logic**, and **run-time** errors in computer programs.

A4.2 Use workplace and professional conventions (e.g., **naming**, **indenting**, **commenting**) correctly to write **programs** and **internal documentation**.

A4.3 Demonstrate the ability to **interpret error messages** displayed by programming tools (e.g., compiler, debugging tool), at different times during the software development process (e.g., writing, compilation, testing).

B1.1 Use **various problem-solving strategies** (e.g., stepwise refinement, divide and conquer, working backwards, examples, extreme cases, tables and charts, trial and error) when solving different types of problems.

B1.2 Demonstrate the ability to **solve problems independently** and as part of a team.

B2.5 Design user-friendly software interfaces (e.g., **prompts**, **messages**, screens, forms).

B3.1 Design **simple algorithms** (e.g., add data to a sorted array, delete a datum from the middle of an array) according to specifications.

B4.2 Use a variety of techniques (e.g., dialogue, questionnaires, surveys, research) to **clarify program specifications**.

B4.5 Use a variety of methods to debug programs (e.g., **manual code tracing**, extra code to output the state of variables).

B4.6 Communicate **information about the status of a project** (e.g., milestones, work completed, work outstanding) effectively in writing throughout the project.

C3.1 Demonstrate an understanding of an integrated software development environment and its main components (e.g., **source code editor**, compiler, debugger).

C3.2 Work independently, using **support documentation** (e.g., IDE Help, tutorials, websites, user manuals), to design and write functioning computer programs.
