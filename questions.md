### Step 2: Plan your game.

1. How does your game work?

→ You guess a word by inputting 1 letter at a time.  Once you guessed the word, you won!  If you run out of turns, you lose.

2. How long do you think it will take to write all the code for this game?

→ 
Thursday - 1.5hr
Friday - 2hr
Saturday - 2hr
Sunday - 1hr
Monday - 2hr
Tuesday - 2hr
Total: 10.5 Hours


3. What do you think will be the most challenging part of creating this game?
→
Creating a menu where it asks the player if they want to play again.  It basically calls a function that has not been created yet.

Example:
loop()
  the loops wants to call on the play function, but it hasn't been created yet.
play()

5. If you happen to finish early, what other features could you try to add to the game to make it better?

→
Maybe making 2 games in 1 game.  

### Step 6: Reflection.

1. What did you enjoy about this project?

→
Learning that you can delay commands and strings by using time.sleep(x)

2. What did you not enjoy about this project?

→ 
Trying to make it replay, it was difficult for me.

3. Describe some of the strategies you used to overcome challenges and difficulties when writing your program.

→
If I have an error, I will solve it when my mind is clear.

4. Were there any features you planned on including but eventually decided not to include? If so, what were they?

→
Implementing 2 games, a nubmer guessing game and hangman.  I couldn't figure out how to do it.

5. If you were to redo this project, what would you do differently?

→
I would use my time more efficently.

6. If you had more experience programming, what would you do to make this game better?

→
I would have better time management and I would have less problems in my code.

7. Would you like to come back to this project later? Why or why not?

→
It's a pretty fun project to make, I would definitely come back to this project.
